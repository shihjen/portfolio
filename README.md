In this individual project for the course SPH6004 Advanced Statistical Learning, I developed a strategy to select the optimal combination of features for predicting the risk of kidney failure in ICU patients using real-world Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from the MIMIC-IV database. The process involved inspecting the dataset for duplicate records and missing values, followed by data preprocessing steps such as encoding, scaling, and imputation. I trained predictive models using various machine learning algorithms, including tree-based methods and boosting algorithms. To achieve optimal model performance, I applied several feature selection techniques, including filter methods, embedded methods, and wrapper methods like recursive feature elimination, stepwise feature selection, and genetic algorithms. 11 models were trained using various feature subsets with different learning algorithms. With the project's goal being the construction of a model capable of accurately estimating the likelihood of ICU patients developing AKI, a preference was given to models exhibiting high average precision. Notably, all models demonstrated comparable AUC (ranging from 0.694 to 0.739) and average precision scores (ranging from 0.801 to 0.847).

Video content has become a dominant medium for information dissemination and entertainment. YouTube, as one of the largest video-sharing platforms, hosts an immense variety of content ranging from educational lectures, news, and tutorials to entertainment. However, the sheer volume of content can be overwhelming for users who may not have the time to watch lengthy videos. A solution to this problem is a web application that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate concise summaries of YouTube video transcripts. This application aims to provide users with quick, comprehensive overviews of video content, saving them time and enhancing their content consumption experience.

The YouTube Sentiment Analyzer is a web application designed to provide detailed sentiment analysis of YouTube video comments. By leveraging the YouTube Data API and the TextBlob library, this tool allows users to:

- Extract Comments: Gather comments from any YouTube video by simply entering the video URL.
- Analyze Sentiment: Categorize comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on computed polarity scores.
- Visualize Data: Generate insightful visualizations including wordcloud, sentiment distributions, and polarity histograms.
